3. Those who have been cancelled by the college for any reason may not obtain the academic registration again for life.

## &#x20;(B) Modification of Academic Registration

1. If a student's academic information is changed, such as changing QQ number, the student's academic record will be changed after the student submits an application.
2. If a student's constructive opinions/suggestions are adopted by the college and have a wide positive impact, they should be recorded on the academic record.
3. Students who have made outstanding contributions to the college or have received recognition for their outstanding performance in college tasks should be recorded in their academic records.
